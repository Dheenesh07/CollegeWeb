            overall health and mental, physical, social well being of women and
            girls throughout the campus.Women and girls face distinct challenges

            Just one thing for the women to understand - ‚ÄúEverything depends
            upon your perspective of seeing yourself.‚ÄùWomen aren‚Äôt weak. They
            are such powerful beings, and it is unfair to be the victims.Women
            should develop the attitude to feel powerful and super strong from
            within and achieve anything they set their minds to.One step towards
            learning self-defence can let women claim the universe.
          </p>

          <h2>Women Entrepreneurship</h2>
          <p>
            ‚ÄúWomen entrepreneurs are those women who innovate, initiate or adopt
            a business activity‚Äù.- Schumpeter The status of women entrepreneurs
            is essential for economic growth. Women now engage not only in their
            respective fields, but also in professions including trade,
            manufacturing and engineering. In order to meet changes in trends,
            challenges global markets and be sufficiently competent to retain
            and aspire for excellence in the entrepreneurial arena. Women
            entrepreneurship must be properly moulded with entrepreneurial
            traits and abilities. The motivational factor behind this desire is
            a sense of independent decision-making towards their careers and
            lives. Women are progressing day by day in this digital era and
            transforming themselves from job-seekers to job creators. Hence,
            women entrepreneurs viewed as an effective strategy to eliminate
            both rural and urban problems.
